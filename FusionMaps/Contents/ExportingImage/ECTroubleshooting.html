  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Before trying the examples from our download package, you need to undertake the necessary setup steps as under:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When running the server-side examples, make sure that you've copied-pasted the relevant export handlers (server-side) to your server. Next, in each example XML/JSON, provide the path to that handler and then try again.</li>
        <li>When running client-side examples, make sure that you've copied-pasted the examples (along with ../Maps folder) to your server (either localhost or remote). The reason why they will not work on local files system is that Adobe Flash Player blocks Flash to JavaScript communication on local file system for security reasons, which FusionMaps XT uses for client-side exporting. If you need to over-ride that for a specific folder, <a href="../../Tools/FlashPlayerSecuritySetup/index.html" target="_blank">read this</a>. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>If it still doesn't work, switch the debug mode of map to on and it'll be able to guide as to what might be wrong. </p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text">
      <p>This CANNOT be done. FusionMaps XT necessarily needs to render once in the browser, before any of the export handlers are called. This is because the maps are always generated at client-side. After that, it takes a snapshot to the client-side Export component or server-side Export scripts for generation of image/PDFs. </p>
      <p>However, please note that our developers have created a .NET based server-side Image Saver Assembly that allows exporting maps as images without rendering it in the browser. Please note that this works only using  .Net framework of Windows. This is an internal implementation, which is not included and/or associated with the FusionMaps XT pack. For receiving the same,  drop us a mail requesting for this assembly at support[@]fusioncharts.com.</p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Make sure of the following:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>You've included <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportComponent.js</span> in your page (after <span class="codeInline">FusionCharts.js</span>)  </li>
        <li>The constructor of <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportObject</span> correctly specifies the path to <span class="codeInline">FCExporter.swf</span> </li>
        <li>The DIV which you've specified in <span class="codeInline">Render(divId)</span> call actually exists. </li>

    <p class="highlightBlock"><strong>Existing users</strong>: Starting FusionMaps XT, use of <span class="codeInline">FusionMapsExportComponent.js</span> is deprecated.  Use <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportComponent.js</span> instead.

    <p>If nothing works, switch the <span class="codeInline">debugMode</span> of component to true (<a href="ECReferenceDebugJS.html">click here for details</a>), and it'll show what went wrong. </p>
